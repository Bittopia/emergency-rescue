## 1.0 What Are Coronaviruses and the Symptoms of Infection?

### 1.1 Coronavirus Family
- Common Cold
- SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
- MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)
- nCoV (COVID-19)

### 1.2 Zoonotic
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.

### 1.3 Incubation Period
The incubation period for the nCoV (COVID-19) is 2 to 12 days. That means if you are in contact with the virus, you can develop symptoms anywhere between 2 to 12 days later. 

### 1.4 Symptoms of COVID-19
The symptoms are presented in several stages. 
#### 1.4.1 Primary Symptoms
Much like the common cold, the first symptoms that can appear in an individual range between:
- Fever
- Headache
- Cough (dry)

#### 1.4.2 Secondary Symptoms
The primary symptoms above may be followed by the following symptoms:
- Sore Throat
- Nasal Congestion
- Malaise (feeling of discomfort, illness, weakness, or fatigue)

#### 1.4.3 Other Symptoms
The above symptoms can progress to:
- Shortness of breath (it means that the disease has involved the lungs)
- Pneumonia 

#### 1.4.4 Severe Cases (Superimposed Pneumonia)
It has been suggested that most people will not develop severe symptoms. Though 0.5% to 2% of people may develop another form of Pneumonia on top of the existing symptoms, called superimposed Pneumonia. This form of Pneumonia is bacterial. 

At this stage, it is much harder to sustain the person as the disease becomes very dangerous and hard to control. 

## 2.0 How the Immune System Functions to Protect You From Infections
Your immune system is very fascinating, interesting, and very complex at the same time. 

### 2.1 Components of the Immune System
Your immune system has five major components:
1. Thymus
2. Lymphatic System
3. Spleen
4. Probiotics
5. White Blood Cells
    - Neutrophils (62%)
    - Lymphocytes (30%)
    - Monocytes (5.3%)
    - Eosinophils (2.3%)
    - Basophils (0.3%)
    - Others (0.1%)

While there are 5 components, in the case of bacterial or viral infections, it is the white blood cells that are going to come and fight first. 

### 2.2 Lines of Defense
There are four layers to your bodies defence system to fight bacterial infections, viral infections, or any kind of inflammation. 

1. Tissue Macrophages<sup>1</sup>
2. Neutrophil Invasion<sup>2</sup>
3. Monocyte Invasion<sup>3</sup>
4. Increase production of WBC by Bone Marrow<sup>4</sup> 


*<sup>1</sup> Timeframe: within a few minutes.* 
*<sup>4</sup> Timeframe: 1 hour or so.* 
*<sup>3</sup> Timeframe: unknown.* 
*<sup>4</sup> Timeframe: 3 to 4 days to produce more white blood cells. It is interesting to note that your bone marrow can increase the production of white blood cells 20 to 50 times the normal, depending on the severity of the situation.* 

## 3.0 General Precautions to Reduce Risk of Coronavirus Infection
This information has been listed in accordance with the WHO (World Health Organization).
- Clean/wash hands with water and soap or alcohol-based solutions. 
- Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
- Avoid contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
- Cook meats and eggs thoroughly. 
- Avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals. 

## 4.0 How to Boost Your Immune System Against Coronavirus Infection
By following the rule of 10, you can boost the function of every single line of defence (see [2.2 Lines of Defense](#22-Lines-of-Defense)). The dosages listed below are for adults. The dosage will need to be adjusted depending on the person. 
1. Rest
2. Warm Liquids
3. Vitamin D | 1000 IU/day<sup>1</sup> 
4. Zinc | 50-100 mg/day
5. Avoid Sugars<sup>2</sup> 
6. Vitamin C | 3000 mg/day
7. Flavonoids | 200 mg/day
8. Vitamin A | 10,000-20,000 IU/day<sup>4</sup> 
9. Vitamin E | 800 IU/day
10. Vitamin B6 | 100 mg/day<sup>5</sup> 


<sup>1</sup> *Vitamin D is the most important nutrient in general for the immune system. It lowers the intensity of coughs and helps with dry coughs. It must be consumed with food. You can also get a Vitamin D injection that would be enough for a month.* 

<sup>2</sup> *Sugars, sweets or refined carbohydrates, they lower the function of Neutrophils by up to 50%.* 

<sup>3</sup> *Vitamin C is unfortunately due to certain publications associated with having a small function in combating viruses or the common cold. For this reason, three points of validation are inserted:* 
- *If you are told that there are dolphins within the ocean and go out and extract a bucket of water from the ocean, and find no dolphins in the bucket, it does not mean dolphins do not exist within the ocean. This reasoning helps to explain that if a study concluded that Vitamin C is not useful it is due to the sample size. The justification is based on the entire spectrum, not a small sample.* 
- *"Linus Pauling was, after all, the leading chemist of the last century and, arguably, the greatest ever American scientist. He remains the only person to have won two unshared Nobel Prizes, the first for Chemistry (1954) and the second for peace (1962). In addition to being one of the greatest scientists ever, he was a renowned humanitarian. 
By the time of his death, the medical establishment had branded Pauling a quack, because he advocated the use of high doses of vitamin C to treat many diseases. Irwin Stone first introduced Pauling to vitamin C, and explained that it wasn't really a vitamin at all, but an essential substance we could no longer manufacture in our bodies. Most animals make their own vitamin C, in large amounts. In humans, the gene for this ability has mutated and no longer works properly."

<sup>5</sup> Vitamin B6 is to be consumed on an empty stomach.
