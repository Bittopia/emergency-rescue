## 1.0 What Are Coronaviruses and the Symptoms of Infection?

### 1.1 Coronavirus Family
- Common Cold
- SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)
- MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)
- nCoV (COVID-19)

### 1.2 Zoonotic
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.

### 1.3 Incubation Period
The incubation period for the nCoV (COVID-19) is 2 to 12 days. That means if you are in contact with the virus, you can develop symptoms anywhere between 2 to 12 days later. 

Note: **Several credible sources have indicated the incubation period can go as high as 24 days in some cases**. (See: [Coronavirus Is Our Future | Alanna Shaikh | TEDxSMU](#53-Videos))


### 1.4 Symptoms of COVID-19
The symptoms are presented in several stages. 
#### 1.4.1 Primary Symptoms
Much like the common cold, the first symptoms that can appear in an individual range between:
- Fever
- Headache
- Cough (dry)

#### 1.4.2 Secondary Symptoms
The primary symptoms above may be followed by the following symptoms:
- Sore Throat
- Nasal Congestion
- Malaise (feeling of discomfort, illness, weakness, or fatigue)

#### 1.4.3 Other Symptoms
The above symptoms can progress to:
- Shortness of breath (it means that the disease has involved the lungs)
- Pneumonia 

#### 1.4.4 Severe Cases (Superimposed Pneumonia)
It has been suggested that most people will not develop severe symptoms. Though 0.5% to 2% of people may develop another form of Pneumonia on top of the existing symptoms, called superimposed Pneumonia. This form of Pneumonia is bacterial. 

At this stage, it is much harder to sustain the person as the disease becomes very dangerous and hard to control. 

## 2.0 How the Immune System Functions to Protect You From Infections
Your immune system is very fascinating, interesting, and very complex at the same time. 

### 2.1 Components of the Immune System
Your immune system has five major components:
1. Thymus
2. Lymphatic System
3. Spleen
4. Probiotics
5. White Blood Cells
    - Neutrophils (62%)
    - Lymphocytes (30%)
    - Monocytes (5.3%)
    - Eosinophils (2.3%)
    - Basophils (0.3%)
    - Others (0.1%)

While there are 5 components, in the case of bacterial or viral infections, it is the white blood cells that are going to come and fight first. 

### 2.2 Lines of Defense
There are four layers to your bodies defence system to fight bacterial infections, viral infections, or any kind of inflammation. 

1. Tissue Macrophages<sup>1</sup>
2. Neutrophil Invasion<sup>2</sup>
3. Monocyte Invasion<sup>3</sup>
4. Increase production of WBC by Bone Marrow<sup>4</sup> 


*<sup>1</sup> Timeframe: within a few minutes.* 

*<sup>4</sup> Timeframe: 1 hour or so.* 

*<sup>3</sup> Timeframe: ?* 

*<sup>4</sup> Timeframe: 3 to 4 days to produce more white blood cells. It is interesting to note that your bone marrow can increase the production of white blood cells 20 to 50 times the normal, depending on the severity of the situation.* 

## 3.0 General Precautions to Reduce Risk of Coronavirus Infection
This information has been listed in accordance with the WHO (World Health Organization).
- Clean/wash hands with water and soap or alcohol-based solutions. 
    - Soap: More than 30 seconds. 
    - Alcohol: Stronger than 60% alcohol (only if you do not have access to soap). 
- Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
- Avoid contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms.
- Cook meats and eggs thoroughly. 
- Avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals. 

### 3.1 Masks

Based on the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks), regarding masks:
- If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
- Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
- Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
- If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.

### 3.2 Gloves
The use of gloves does not replace the need for cleaning your hands. 

> Gloves create a false sense of cleanliness, which ultimately leads to gloves being used incorrectly and employees not washing their hands well or as often as they should.

### 3.3 Additional Tips

- Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. 
- You can gargle saltwater and vinegar for relieving symptoms related to colds and flus, such as sore throats.

### 3.4 Colodial Silver
Colloidal silver doesn't work in the body. it gets captured by your own membranes and cant attack the virus anywhere else. 

## 4.0 How to Boost Your Immune System Against Coronavirus Infection
By following the rule of 10, you can boost the function of every single line of defence (see [2.2 Lines of Defense](#22-Lines-of-Defense)). The dosages listed below are for adults. The dosage will need to be adjusted depending on the person. 
1. Rest
2. Warm Liquids
3. [Vitamin D](#41-Vitamin-D) | 10,000 IU/day 
4. [Zinc](#42-Zinc) | 50-100 mg/day
5. [Avoid Sugars](#43-Sugars-Sweets-and-Refined-Carbohydrates)
6. [Vitamin C](#44-Vitamin-C) | 3000 mg/day
7. [Flavonoids](#45-Flavonoid) | 200 mg/day
8. [Vitamin A](#46-Vitamin-A) | 10,000-20,000 IU/day
9. [Vitamin E](#47-Vitamin-E) | 800 IU/day
10. [Vitamin B6](#48-Vitamin-B6) | 100 mg/day

### 4.1 Vitamin D

Vitamin D is the most important nutrient in general for the immune system. It lowers the intensity of coughs and helps with dry coughs. It must be consumed with food. You can also get a Vitamin D injection that would be enough for a month or the 50,000 IU pills which can be taken once a week which may be easier to manage.

#### 4.1.1 Natural Source

> A major source of vitamin D for most humans is synthesized from the exposure of the skin to sunlight typically between 1000 h and 1500 h (between 10 am and 3 pm) in the spring, summer, and fall/autumn. Vitamin D produced in the skin may last at least twice as long in the blood compared with ingested vitamin D. 
> 
> When an adult wearing a bathing suit is exposed to one minimal erythemal dose of UV radiation (a slight pinkness to the skin 24 h after exposure), the amount of vitamin D produced is equivalent to ingesting between 10,000 and 25,000 IU. A variety of factors reduce the skin's production of vitamin D3, including increased skin pigmentation, aging, and the topical application of a sunscreen. An alteration in the zenith angle of the sun caused by a change in latitude, season of the year, or time of day dramatically influences the skin's production of vitamin D3. -- Vitamin D: The “sunshine” vitamin, 2012
> 

**Unit of measurement:**
Vitamin E: 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.67 mg d-alpha-tocopherol
#### 4.1.2 Why are we Vitamin D deficient? 

> Vitamin D insufficiency affects almost 50% of the population worldwide. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide, across all ethnicities and age groups, have a vitamin D deficiency (VDD). This pandemic of hypovitaminosis D can mainly be attributed to lifestyle (for example, reduced outdoor activities) and environmental (for example, air pollution) factors that reduce exposure to sunlight, which is required for ultraviolet-B (UVB)-induced vitamin D production in the skin. -- Vitamin D: The “sunshine” vitamin, 2012
> 

### 4.2 Zinc
Zinc is one of the most important minerals for immune function. Zinc is considered an essential nutrient, meaning that your body can’t produce or store it. It plays an important role in:

- Gene expression
- Enzymatic reactions
- Immune function
- Protein synthesis
- DNA synthesis
- Wound healing
- Growth and development

#### 4.2.2 Zinc for Vegetarians
> Locally, an Australian study assessed zinc intake and status in vegetarian and vegan men and women, between 18-45 years, compared to an omnivore control group. It was revealed that overall zinc intakes were higher in men than in women, and that vegetarian women had a significantly lower intake than their omnivore counterparts.
> 
> But then, when measuring serum zinc via blood tests, they found vegetarian women, despite their lower zinc intake, did not have significantly different serum levels. This may be due to increased absorption and reduced excretion. Surprisingly, they found vegetarian men to have even higher serum zinc than their omnivore counterparts, despite similar intakes. Based on these results, zinc deficiency may not be a problem for healthy vegetarians. However, considering dairy is not a great source of zinc, and a single large egg only contains about 0.6mg zinc, this may also be true for vegans.

### 4.3 Sugars, Sweets, and Refined Carbohydrates
Sugars, sweets or refined carbohydrates, they lower the function of Neutrophils by up to 50%. These include white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, sweet desserts, and many breakfast cereals. 

### 4.4 Vitamin C
> Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a small carbohydrate molecule first identified in the 1920s by Albert von Szent Györgyi, who discovered that it was able to prevent and cure scurvy. Scurvy is a pathological life-threatening condition suffered by people who do not have access to fruits or vegetables for long periods of time. 
> 
> Apart from its deficiency causing scurvy in humans, vitamin C is also vitally important to other species. Neither animals nor plants can live without vitamin C, and it is therefore surprising that some animals (some fishes and birds, and a few mammals, including guinea pigs, [bats], and humans) have lost the capability to produce it over the course of evolution.
> 

**Note 1:**
> Vitamin C is easily destroyed by excessive heat and water, as well as exposure to air. For retention of vitamin C in cooked foods, it is recommended that foods containing vitamin C be cooked as fast as possible with less heat and small amount of water.
> 

**Note 2:**

A 2011 study from China showed that a specific type of bats can produce Vitamin C on demand. See:
[Recent Loss of Vitamin C Biosynthesis Ability in Bats](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027114&type=printable)

#### 4.4.1 Depletion 

> Vitamin C is used up even more rapidly during emotional stress, alcohol, or smoking. Vitamin C blood levels of smokers are much lower than those of nonsmokers given the same intakes. Other situations reduce absorption or increase depletion of vitamin C include fever, viral illness, antibiotics, cortisone, aspirin, pain medicines, environmental toxins such as DDT, petroleum products, carbon monoxide, exposure to heavy metals such as lead, mercury or cadmium. Sulfa antibiotics increase elimination of vitamin C from the body by two to three times the normal rate. 

#### 4.4.2 Natural Source of Vitamin C

- Large Orange: ~100mg
- Medium Orange: ~60mg
- Kiwi: ~60mg
- Pomelo: ~300mg
- Mango: ~120mg
- Papaya: ~200mg
- Green Chili Pepper: ~100mg

#### 4.4.3 Dosage
> Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, which means it dissolves in water. In contrast to fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins do not get stored within the body. Instead, the vitamin C that you consume gets transported to your tissues via body fluids, and **any extra gets excreted in urine**.

You can increase the dosage up to 1,500 mg every 3 or 4 hours and as high as 1,000 mg every hour. 


#### 4.4.4 I have heard that the benefits of Vitamin C are not proven...

Vitamin C is unfortunately due to certain publications associated with having a small function in combating viruses or the common cold. For this reason, three points of validation are inserted:

- *If you are told that there are dolphins within the ocean and go out and extract a bucket of water from the ocean, and find no dolphins in the bucket, it does not mean dolphins do not exist within the ocean. This reasoning helps to explain that if a study concluded that Vitamin C is not useful it is due to the sample size. The justification is based on the entire spectrum, not a small sample.* 
- *"Linus Pauling was, after all, the leading chemist of the last century and, arguably, the greatest ever American scientist. He remains the only person to have won two unshared Nobel Prizes, the first for Chemistry (1954) and the second for peace (1962). In addition to being one of the greatest scientists ever, he was a renowned humanitarian. 
By the time of his death, the medical establishment had branded Pauling a quack, because he advocated the use of high doses of vitamin C to treat many diseases. Irwin Stone first introduced Pauling to vitamin C, and explained that it wasn't really a vitamin at all, but an essential substance we could no longer manufacture in our bodies. Most animals make their own vitamin C, in large amounts. In humans, the gene for this ability has mutated and no longer works properly."

### 4.5 Flavonoid
> Flavonoids show a strong antioxidant and radical scavenging activity and appear to be associated with reduced risk for certain chronic diseases, the prevention of some cardiovascular disorders and certain kinds of cancerous processes. Flavonoids exhibit also antiviral, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities, beneficial effects on capillary fragility and an ability to inhibit human platelet aggregation, antiulcer and antiallergenic properties.

> Flavonoids are various compounds found naturally in many fruits and vegetables. They’re also in plant products like wine, tea, and chocolate. There are six different types of flavonoids found in food, and each kind is broken down by your body in a different way.
> 
> ...Flavonoids may also influence the ability of vitamin C to be absorbed and utilized by the body.

#### Natural Sources of Flavonoid
- Citrus Fruits ()
- Legumes
- Cocoa Beans
- Dark Chocolate
- Tea

> ...unsweetened baking chocolate has 206 milligrams of flavanols per 100 grams of chocolate

### 4.6 Vitamin A
Vitamin A is important for good vision, healthy skin and for supporting your immune system.

Note: To be consumed with food.

#### 4.6.1 Vitamin A Deficiency
> You may be deficient in vitamin A if your body is unable to absorb it properly from your food. This may happen if you:
> 
> - drink a lot of alcohol
> - have a medical condition such as anorexia nervosa, liver disease, cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease
> - have recently had gastrointestinal surgery

**Note:**
> Having too much vitamin A in your body can cause serious health problems, including nausea, hair loss, blurred eyesight, orange skin colour and an inability to control body movement.
> 
> In pregnant women, too much vitamin A can cause birth defects.

#### 4.6.2 Natural Sources of Vitamin A

> ..about 45% of people carry a genetic mutation that significantly reduces their ability to convert provitamin A into vitamin A.
> 
> Depending on your genetics ...vegetables might provide considerably less vitamin A than indicated.

- Lean meats, liver or liver pate, poultry, oily fish and egg yolks
- Leafy green vegetables, as well as orange, yellow and other coloured vegetables
- Legumes and beans
- Fruit, including tomatoes
- Nuts and seeds
- Butter, whole milk, yoghurt, cheese and/or their alternatives, mostly reduced-fat

**Example**
1 large egg: 245.1 IU

**Unit of measurement:**
Vitamin A: 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.3 mcg retinol

### 4.7 Vitamin E
> Vitamin E is important for proper functioning of many of the body's organs. It helps to maintain healthy skin, good vision, and correct functioning of the immune system.

#### 4.7.1 Natural Sources of Vitamin E
- Sunflower seeds
- Almonds
- Spinach
- Avocados
- Squash
- Kiwifruit
- Trout
- Olive oil
- Wheat germ oil
- Broccoli

**Example**
Sunflower Seeds: 100 g = ~25 mg = ~16 IU Vitamin E

**Unit of measurement:**
Vitamin E: 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.67 mg d-alpha-tocopherol

### 4.8 Vitamin B6
> Vitamin B-6 (pyridoxine) is important for normal brain development and for keeping the nervous system and immune system healthy.
> 
>Your body cannot produce vitamin B6, so you must obtain it from foods or supplements.
>

**Note:** Vit B6 is to be consumed on an empty stomach.

#### 4.8.1 Natural Sources of Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods, including:

- Poultry, such as chicken or turkey
- Fish
- Bread
- Wholegrain cereals, such as oatmeal, wheatgerm and - Brown rice
- Eggs
- Vegetables
- Peanuts
- Potatoes

Example
Spinach: 100 g = 195 mcg = ~0.2 g


## 5.0 Things to Avoid
As well as carbohydrates, sugars, and sweets, you should reduce or remove the following:
- Smoking (Smoking may rob the body of vitamin C and D)
- Coffee (affects vitamin D and Calcium levels)
- Alcohol (affects minerals and vitamins absorption and levels)
- Cooked Foods (it damages/destroys the vitamins and nutrients, the longer they cook, and the higher the temperature, the greater the nutrient destruction.)
- Stress & Anxiety (can weaken your immune response)


Note: 
> After eating a cooked meal, there is a rush of white blood cells towards the digestive tract, leaving the rest of the body less protected by the immune system. From the point of view of the immune system, the body is being invaded by a foreign (toxic) substance when cooked food is eaten.
> ... Back in 1930, the Swiss researchers at the institute of Chemical Chemistry made a remarkable discovery. They found that eating raw, unaltered food did not cause a reaction in the blood. In addition, they found that if a food had been heated beyond a certain temperature (unique to each food), or if the food was processed (refined, chemicals added, etc.), this always caused a rise in the number of white cells in the blood.
> 

There are some points indicating that the above may not be true or that the experiment may not have been conducted in the correct manner. What we know for sure is that when you cook vegetables, most of the needed nutrients and vitamins are destroyed. 

## 6.0 Alkalinity
This topic can be controversial, though we can simply say it is best to consume fresh fruits and vegetables, or foods that are in their natural state.

The cleaner your diet and intake are, the more sensitive you will become to foods. You can use that feeling to test various foods and the impact it has on your energy and overall stamina. Keep in mind though that switching to a new diet should be done slowly, to give your body time to adjust.

## 7.0 Super Foods

### 7.1 Chaga Mushrooms
> In animal and cell-based studies, it [chaga mushrooms] prevented the following viruses from infecting cells and replicating:
> 
> - HIV
> - Herpes simplex
> - Epstein-Barr 
> - Hepatitis C
> 
> Both hot water and ethanol extracts of Chaga are able to kill bacterial and fungal cells in cell culture.

Other alternatives to Chaga depending on your location:

> - Chuchuasi, cat's claw, pau'de arco & others... Chuchuasi has the same effect of inhibiting CL protease against HIV as does Chaga.
> 

[Chuchuhuasi or “Tree of Life” in Venezuela](https://www.life-enthusiast.com/articles/chuchuhuasi/)

### 7.2 Elderberry
> Rubini elderberry liquid extract is active against human pathogenic bacteria as well as influenza viruses. The activities shown suggest that additional and alternative approaches to combat infections might be provided by this natural product.
> 
Elderberry has also shown to be effective against pneumonia. Also very useful for people who suffer from asthma.
