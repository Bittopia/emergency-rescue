# Year Zero

I do not mean to alarm people, I am hoping things will all be fine, though as some of you may or may not know, I have spent more than a quarter of my life warning people about the dangers of centralization, preparing for what is happening right now. 

This includes the global financial system (invented by the Federal Reserve, a private organization within the US) that has come to lock lips with most countries apart from Cuba, Iran and North Korea. I believe based on my own findings and others around me, that we are reaching a very challenging stage of humanity.

We will be reversing the grips of globalization and returning to nationalization, for how long, I do not know. I believe the virus was the catalyst to an inevitable event. As when the world is looking at something, there is usually something else much greater going on that we do not see. I believe the virus will be used to herd people back into their cages, the fear will be used to introduce new policies, and to shape people into a pre-determined direction.

I have found that the virus is designed to target people with Vitamin C and D deficiencies, which includes most of the modern world that barely get sunlight (due to their region or working in an office), that consume larget amounts of coffee and alcohol. 

> "Smokers have more difficulty absorbing nutrients than non-smokers. In addition to absorbing the toxins from cigarette smoke, smokers are inhaling nutrient thieves that rob them of some of the vitamins and minerals that are necessary to fight off the ill effects of smoking. Smoking robs the body of the antioxidant vitamin C. It's believed that smokers need 35 milligrams more vitamin C each day than nonsmokers.

> Smoking also can rob the body of vitamin D, a nutrient that helps develop strong immune systems, prevent autoimmune disorders, and regulate the release of insulin. Vitamin D also helps the body absorb bone-strengthening calcium, so smoking leads to a higher risk of osteoporosis."

The above also applies to sugar, coffee, alcohol, and stress. The perfect cocktail of the modern style of life. This is why many are saying this is a bioweapon specifically designed to target the average modern human.

This is based on the findings of an algorithm that Cliff High is running via his Web Bot:

> The same Web Bot predicted that in 2008 – “There’ll be a major stock market crash or a climate event that has a disastrous effect on the economy.” furthermore "Since his first high profile prediction of the events of 911, he has been credited for predicting many other events such as the anthrax attack in Washington, the crash of American 587, the Columbia disaster, the Northeast Power outage, the Banda Aceh earthquake and more recently, Trump’s victory in the national election."

I know this is a bit much for a lot of people to comprehend, especially if this is the first time you have to consider that the world is staged rather than naturally playing out.

## Recommendations

- Chances are you are going to get the virus. You have to fight it internally by strengthening your immune system. If you have a weak immune system you become a transporter and a host to infect others. It is your responsibility for both yourself and others to harden yourself and make sure you do not become a relay host. Increase your intake and supply of Vitamin C, B-Vitamins, and Vitamin D + anti-virals like Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus). Eat clean, exercise and get your sunlight (Vitamin D).

> "It is very important to break through the cognitive dissonance and mental barriers early because we have not experienced it yet. Testing is useless, quarantine is useless. We need to be adults until we actually face that its a bio-weapon and you can't run away from it, there is only one resource available to us at the moment and that is to harden ourselves individually and enact those firebreaks and its progression, and assume we are going to get exposed and say yeh, so what, who cares, that bastard can't get in me, I got so much vitamin C and Chaga in me, it'll die..." -- Clif High

- Globalization has placed most countries in a situation where they have to rely on others to produce their goods. We all are aware that this is the case with our relation regarding China. China has paused certain shipments to the US as they are blaming the US for the production of the virus. If the CCP ceases the supply of all major products, you will not have the necessary components to continue a "normal" life.

- The notion that is will go away once we are in summer and the temperatures are warmer is garbage. It is already spreading to parts of the world where it is summer or is tropical. Watch Cliff High and his view on this.

- Hold onto cash if possible, in the form of USD. People are going to soon realise that the phantom money they were paying interest on never existed. That their fantasy world of economic growth and prosperity was based on nothing but debt. I believe shock will have a great impact on such people as opposed to people who are aware, or are or have lived through it. 92% of the world's money is digital. The banks have been giving out loans on money that never existed. As a bank only needs to hold 10% of what they lend. As in, they can loan out $1M and charge interest on that phantom money, while only having $100K in their reserve (this is how the global financial system works in a very simple way). There are already cases within Vienna of people increasing their ATM withdraws: https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/austrian-bank-job-begins-atm-usage-double-triple

- I believe that the situation in Cyprus was a test (where people were limited in how much money they can withdraw from an ATM per day after the 2008 GFC). As such, I believe the same will occur on a larger scale.

- If you have the money, please purchase 1 Bitcoin per family. If you do not hold your private key for your bitcoin, you do not own your bitcoin, it's simple. if you purchased bitcoin on an exchange because you were used to convenience, then reverse this role and make sure you remove your coin(s) from exchanges or places that you purchased them and move them onto a hardware wallet or cold wallets (offline).

- Purchase physical gold and silver if possible. 

- I believe the international borders will come to close on a global scale. Place yourself where you need to be for some time. You may even be requested to return to your home country if travelling as a tourist. Whether you follow that request or not is your decision. 

- Please do not let fear take over you. You may come to see ane experience some terrible things moving forward. Try and do the opposite of what the crowd/herd is doing.
